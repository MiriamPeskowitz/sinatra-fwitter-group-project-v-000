Wow, just setting up folders and creating migrations takes awhile 

1. login/logout
  -- GET to /login and get login form
  -- POST to /login to submit login form
  -- GET to /logout -- clear the session hash
2. current_user and logged_in?
3. only user can edit their own tweets
4. Signup
  -- Put signup link on homepage
  -- GET to get the form /signup. log in user, add user_id to sessions hash
  -- POST to /signup submit -- this should create the user and save to db

5.

5. edit -- two actions
  -- GET /tweets/:id/edit
  -- POST /tweets/:id
  -- put edit link on tweet show page

6. delete POST to tweets/:id/delete
  -- the form should be on the tweet show page. No fields, just a button.
